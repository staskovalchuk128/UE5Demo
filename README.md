<h1>UE5 (Unnamed yet) game description</h1>
<p>
I started doing this project in early 2024 and I love working on it in my free time.
This is an open-world game set in medieval Europe. The goal of the game is to conquer the whole world. The player needs to wander around the world and look for castles that he will need to capture. The player has a catapult that deals good damage from a distance, as well as the player has the opportunity to throw a spear at his enemies and use a sword for close combat.

<p><strong>Below you can see the progress of what I am working on, I think in the coming months I will finally finish this project and publish it on Steam.</strong></p>
